# SOLID principles of object-oriented programming

1. (S) Single Responsibility (single-responsibility.ts).
2. (O) Open–closed principle (open–closed.ts).
3. (L) Liskov substitution principle (liskov-substitution.ts)
4. (I) Interface segregation principle (interface-segregation.ts)
5. (D) Dependency inversion principle (dependency-inversion.ts)

## Single Responsibility

A class should have one reason for change

Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems 

to run example:

```bash
$ npm run solid-s
```

## Open–closed

Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

to run example:

```bash
$ npm run solid-o
```

## Liskov substitution

You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

to run example:

```bash
$ npm run solid-l
```

## Interface segregation

Don't put too much into an interface, split into separate interfaces

to run example:

```bash
$ npm run solid-i
```


## Dependency inversion

High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones, use abstraction. 

to run example:

```bash
$ npm run solid-d
```
